# Gapminder World data set investigation

This project is part of a Udacity online course (Data analyst nanodegree). It is the first one out of four. It comes after a lesson explaining the basics
of data analysis process where we learn how to gather, clean and explore data. Conclusions based on selected metrics are drawn after these steps and findings are shared at the end.

Udacity suggests several data set options. I chose to use the "Gapminder world" one. Gapminder collects a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries,
tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. The data was downloaded from Gapminder's website in csv format to be used in the project.
You will find the data set I worked with in the folder, in case it changed on Gapminder's website.

In this project, I chose to answer to the following questions (using visuals):
- How is income distributed in the world in 2020 comapred to 1950 ? (Visual = Histogram)
- How did life expectency change through time for each region ? (Visual = Line chart)
- Do countries with higher income achieve better higher human developpement index ? (Visual = Bar chart)
- Is there any correlation between inqueality and corruption rates in europe ? (Visual = Scatter plot)

To do this, I will be using several functions from pandas, numpy and matplotlib packages.
